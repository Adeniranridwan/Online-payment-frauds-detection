# Online-payment-frauds-detection

This report uses data analytics and machine learning approaches in detecting financial fraud.  Several models such as Logistic regression (LR), Decision tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), and techniques like feature selection were experimented with to find the best methods that effectively detect fraudulent transactions. The result shows that Random Forest outperformed other models used in the experiment. The performance of Random Forest is evident in many literatures (Varmedja et al, 2019, Manjeevan et al., 2021).
There are many literatures that emphasize the importance of feature selection and data sampling in improving model performance. On the contrary, some literature also reported that the application of feature selection has negligible or no effect on the model performance. This shows that there is no "best method" that is fit for all problem settings. This effect on the model performance depends on the dataset and the feature selection methods used.
Experimental findings from this study show that the implementation of feature selection methods has no significant impact on the baseline model's performance. The application of methods like Boruta feature selection and SelectKbest with Random Forest have the same superior accuracy of 98% as the baseline model performance without prior application of feature selection technique and the same Naive Bayes model performance of 97.17% accuracy as the least while the recursive feature elimination method decreases the baseline model performance of the decision tree, naive Bayes, and random Forest. This study confirms the outcome of Jiarpakdee et al in the literature. Nevertheless, the implementation of feature selection is evident in many literatures to increase the model performance. Using the right feature selection technique can impact the model's performance (Hasan & Bao 2021, Reddy et al. 2019, Sharma et al., (2021). Moreover, of all the feature selection methods experimented with, the impact of Boruta feature selection on the overall model performance overweighed other techniques. 
In addition, the application of synthesis minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have no increase in the performance of the machine learning models but causes a significant decrease in Na√Øve Bayes model performance.
There are several technical limitations to this study. The experiments were conducted using an on-premise computer system which accompanied high computational cost and system failure sometimes. Moreover, real world dataset was not used for these experiments which question the formality of the result. Hence, the direct implementation of these findings to other may take slightly different approach like special attention to the data tidiness, quality and an advanced machine learning methods depending on the dataset. Moreover, In the case of real word data, the collection and usage of data need to comply with the privacy, security, ethics, legal and regulatory rules.
